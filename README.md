# first Repo's README.md file
Hello, My name is Piyush Singh Bhati.<br>
<p>I am just getting started with github, so this is my first repository(not officially though), actually I have created a repository before but that time I was not trying to learn to use Github, well I was, but like not in a very dedicated way.</p>

Well, I just got to know that <br> statement just acts like "\n" statement, oops
\<\b\r\> maybe, shit...I don't know HTML<br>
Well I learned something from the above line that in HTML syntax also "\" is used as an escape sequence to print the keyword characters.<br>
